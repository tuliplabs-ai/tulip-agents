"""Coverage tests for the *helpers* in ``tulip.agent.runtime_loop``.

The runtime loop methods themselves require a fully-initialised ``Agent``
to drive — those are exercised by the agent end-to-end tests. This file
hits the small, self-contained pieces:

- ``_normalize_stop_reason`` — maps free-form reasons to the typed Literal
