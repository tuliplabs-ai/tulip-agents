"""Multi-turn regression test: checkpointed state + new user message must
re-enter the model.

Regression: the loop used to read `should_terminate` at the start of every
run, and the old implementation returned `(True, "no_tools")` whenever
`iteration > 0` and any assistant message existed anywhere in history.
A checkpointed conversation resumes with `iteration > 0` by design, so the
check fired before the Think node ever ran — the model was never called for
any turn after the first.
