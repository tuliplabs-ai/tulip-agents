"""Routing-accuracy benchmark for ``tulip.router``.

This is the load-bearing artifact behind the SDK's headline claim:
**bounded graph generation via typed goal frames is more accurate than
free-form LLM routing**. Every PR that touches ``tulip.router`` should
re-run this benchmark; the table it prints is the empirical evidence
behind the design.

Three ablations, run against the same labelled corpus:

* **Full** — the default router: typed :class:`GoalFrame` extraction +
  :class:`ProtocolRegistry` with ``primary_for`` canonical ranking.
* **NoCanonical** — same router, but every protocol's
  ``primary_for`` is wiped to ``[]``. Isolates the contribution of the
  canonical-match tiebreaker in :func:`_rank_key`.
* **FreeForm** — the LLM picks ``protocol_id`` directly via a
  flat output schema (no :class:`GoalFrame`, no registry). The
  baseline that "let the LLM pick the topology" frameworks
  effectively run.

For each ablation we measure four things over the corpus:

* ``goal_acc`` — fraction of frames whose extracted ``primary_goal``
  matches the labelled ``expected_goal`` (Full + NoCanonical only).
* ``protocol_acc`` — fraction whose selected protocol matches
  ``expected_protocol``.
* ``bounded_rate`` — fraction whose selected protocol is in the
  registered set (the boundedness guarantee). Should be 1.0 for the
  router; the FreeForm baseline can hallucinate ids.
* ``extract_fail_rate`` — fraction where the LLM produced something
  the schema rejected.

Skipped without a real provider. Anthropic Haiku-4.5 is the cheap
default; the conftest also resolves OpenAI when its env vars are set.

# Adversarial corpus — designed to *break* boundedness in the FreeForm
# baseline while leaving the typed router unaffected. Two flavours:
#
#   1. **Prompt-injection** — explicitly tells the LLM to ignore the
#      protocol list and invent a name. The typed router can't comply
#      because ``GoalFrame.primary_goal`` is a closed StrEnum; the
#      registry then maps to a real protocol. The FreeForm baseline
#      can comply because its schema accepts any ``str``.
#   2. **Out-of-distribution / ambiguous** — prompts where no protocol
#      is the obviously-right answer (creative writing, conversational,
#      empty-ish). Tests how the LLM degrades when forced to choose.
#
# We don't assign an ``expected_protocol`` for these — the metric is
# pure ``bounded_rate``: how often the selection lives in the
# registered set. The router is bounded by construction (100% required);
# the FreeForm baseline is bounded only by the model's cooperation.

      is a closed StrEnum; the registry only emits known ids.
      Extraction may fail on adversarial prompts, but the system's
      response is *constrained* even then (we record ``no-parse``).
    * **NoCanonical**: same as Full — boundedness is structural, not
      dependent on canonical-match ranking.
    * **FreeForm**: bounded only by model cooperation. We expect a
      measurable drop on injection prompts (model invents protocol
      ids) and possibly on ambiguous prompts (model hedges).

    The test asserts ``Full.bounded == Full.n`` (the structural claim)
