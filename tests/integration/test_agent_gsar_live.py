"""Live integration tests for ``Agent(gsar=GSARConfig(...))``.

Exercises the single-pass v1 wiring end-to-end:

- An ``Agent`` with one ``@tool`` produces a tool-grounded answer; the
  configured GSAR judge sees the answer + tool execution as evidence
  and surfaces a ``proceed`` decision on ``AgentResult``.
- An ``Agent`` whose model spits out an unsupported claim (no tool
  invoked) gets caught by the judge — the agent's result carries a
  non-``proceed`` decision and a non-empty ungrounded partition.

Activation: ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` (uses ``gpt-4o-mini`` for both the
agent and the judge).
