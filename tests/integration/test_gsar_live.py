"""Live integration tests for the GSAR layer.

These hit a real LLM judge and exercise the full Algorithm-1 outer
loop end-to-end:

- A clearly-grounded report should land at ``δ = proceed`` on the
  first iteration. Asserts the judge correctly recognises tool-typed
  evidence and the score function clears ``τ_proceed = 0.80``.
- A clearly-ungrounded / contradicted report should not land at
  ``proceed`` on the first iteration; the loop should escalate to
  ``replan`` (or, with a generous threshold, ``regenerate``).
- The trajectory log must be monotonically non-decreasing in
  ``iteration`` and present the right number of entries.

Activation: ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` (uses ``gpt-4o-mini`` as the judge).
Skipped automatically when the key isn't set.
