"""Plugin system for composable agent extensions.

Plugins bundle hooks and tools into a single reusable unit.
Methods decorated with @hook are auto-discovered and registered.
Methods decorated with @tool are auto-discovered and added to the agent.

Example:
    from tulip.hooks.plugin import Plugin, hook

    class LoggingPlugin(Plugin):
        name = "logging"

        @hook
        async def on_before_model_call(self, event):
            print(f"Calling model with {len(event.messages)} messages")

        @hook
        async def on_after_tool_call(self, event):
            print(f"Tool {event.tool_name} returned {len(event.result or '')} chars")

    agent = Agent(config=AgentConfig(
        model=model,
        plugins=[LoggingPlugin()],
