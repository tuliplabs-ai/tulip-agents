"""Structured task tracker for the deep agent.

Mirrors deepagents' ``write_todos`` tool: the agent maintains a list
of ``{content, status}`` items it updates between steps. The status
is a plain string (``"pending" | "in_progress" | "completed"``) —
not a Pydantic ``Literal``, per the project convention that
LLM-populated fields stay loose so the model doesn't crash on a
status it hasn't seen before.

The TODO list is *agent-driven*: nothing forces the agent to use it.
Tools-attached, prompt-encouraged, agent-decided.
