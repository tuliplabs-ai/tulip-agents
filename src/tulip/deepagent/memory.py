"""``AGENTS.md``-style memory file loading.

Loads one or more Markdown instruction files at startup and joins
them so :func:`create_deepagent` can prepend the result to the
agent's system prompt. Layered (base → user → project), matching
the convention at <https://agents.md/>.

Missing paths are skipped silently so a default list with optional
locations can be passed without ``FileNotFoundError`` blowing up the
factory.
