"""Singleton pub/sub event bus for tulip telemetry.

A leaner adaptation of an optic-style ``EventBus`` (see
``optic.observability.core.event_bus``). Same semantic surface
— per-run channels + global subscribers, bounded queues, history
replay for late connections, sentinel-based stream close — without
the production-grade backpressure-warning machinery, which we don't
need at v1 scale.

The tulip hook system (:class:`tulip.hooks.HookProvider`) and the
router both publish through here. The workbench's SSE endpoint at
``/api/events/{run_id}`` is the HTTP wrapper around
:meth:`EventBus.subscribe`.
