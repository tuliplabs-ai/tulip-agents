"""Context-local correlation id for opt-in telemetry.

Every emission point in the SDK reads :func:`current_run_id` and
no-ops when it returns ``None``. That gives us two properties at once:

* **Telemetry is opt-in.** Users who never call :func:`run_context`
  (or pass ``run_id`` to :meth:`Router.dispatch`) pay zero cost — no
  bus instantiated, no events constructed, no imports beyond this
  module.
* **Telemetry composes through the call tree.** Once a ``run_id`` is
  set on the current asyncio context, every nested call — orchestrators
  invoking specialists, pipelines spawning agents, agents firing tool
  hooks — sees the same id and tags every event with it.

Two ways to enter a run context:

* :func:`run_context` — async context manager with explicit
  ``__aenter__`` / ``__aexit__`` semantics. Preferred for code paths
  that want to control the close (and, e.g., trigger
  :meth:`EventBus.close_stream`).
* :meth:`Router.dispatch` — sets the contextvar implicitly for the
  duration of the dispatch, generates a fresh ``uuid4`` if none was
  provided.
