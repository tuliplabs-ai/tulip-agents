"""Lightweight emit helpers — single line per instrumentation site.

The contract for every emission site in the SDK:

* **Sync call sites** use :func:`emit_sync`. It schedules a publish on
  the running event loop *if there is one*; otherwise drops. Never
  blocks, never raises.
* **Async call sites** use :func:`emit`. Awaits the bus publish so
  events appear in deterministic order on the consumer side.

Both check :func:`current_run_id` first. When the contextvar is unset
they return immediately — no bus singleton instantiation, no event
construction, no allocation. SDK users who don't use telemetry pay
exactly one ``ContextVar.get()`` per emission site.

Module-level event-name constants pin the canonical wire types so
changes are greppable and consumers (the workbench, third-party
monitors) can rely on them.
