"""Hook lifecycle orchestration for :class:`~tulip.agent.agent.Agent`.

Six lifecycle phases — ``before_invocation``, ``after_invocation``,
``before_model_call``, ``after_model_call``, ``before_tool_call``,
``after_tool_call`` — are dispatched through this class. Every
``after_*`` phase runs in reverse order of registration so a hook
registered last gets to clean up first (symmetrical with a
``before_*`` pair).

Extracted from ``Agent`` so the runtime isn't responsible for
both driving the ReAct loop and dispatching hooks. The behavior is
identical to the previous inline ``_run_*_hooks`` methods — same
method signatures, same ordering, same write-through of
``event.messages`` / ``event.arguments``.
