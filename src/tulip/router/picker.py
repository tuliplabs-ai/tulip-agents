"""Opt-in LLM protocol picker — the second selection mode.

The default routing path is :meth:`ProtocolRegistry.select`, a
deterministic tuple-rank in :func:`_rank_key`. This module adds a
second mode where the model picks the protocol from an
already-filtered candidate set, returning a typed
:class:`PickedProtocol` (id + rationale).

The picker is strictly opt-in. Pass an instance to
``CognitiveCompiler(protocol_picker=...)``; default callers see no
change. PolicyGate still runs after selection, and the candidate set
is filtered by the same three gates the rule-based path uses — the
LLM only resolves the *last-mile* ambiguity when multiple protocols
qualify.
