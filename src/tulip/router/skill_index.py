"""Skill metadata layered on top of :class:`tulip.skills.Skill`.

The router uses skills the same way the agent loop already does — via
:class:`tulip.skills.SkillsPlugin` and its progressive-disclosure
catalog. The index here only adds the *domain* metadata the router
needs to scope skills per :class:`GoalFrame.domain`, and resolves the
skills the chosen builder should attach to every emitted ``Agent``.

There is no parallel skill storage. The :class:`Skill` instances live
where they were loaded (``Skill.from_directory(...)``) — the index just
holds them with a domain tag so the compiler can hand the right subset
to each builder.
