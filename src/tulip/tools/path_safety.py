"""Filesystem path-traversal guard for tools that open user-supplied paths.

Tulip does not ship built-in filesystem tools by default, but users
frequently author their own (``@tool def read_file(path: str) -> str:
...``). Any such tool that joins a model-supplied path to a trusted
base directory is vulnerable to path-traversal via ``../../etc/passwd``,
URL-encoded variants (``%2e%2e``), symlink indirection, or absolute
paths. This helper collapses all of those into one canonical
"resolve-and-contain" check so user tools can stay focused on I/O.

Typical use::

    from pathlib import Path
    from tulip.tools.path_safety import safe_resolve
    from tulip.tools.decorator import tool

    ALLOWED_ROOT = Path("/srv/workspace").resolve()


    @tool
    def read_file(relative_path: str) -> str:
        target = safe_resolve(ALLOWED_ROOT, relative_path)
        return target.read_text()

Guarantees:

* The returned path is fully resolved (``Path.resolve(strict=False)``),
  so symlinks inside it are followed and normalised. If the resolved
  target escapes ``base``, :class:`tulip.core.errors.ValidationError`
  is raised.
* Absolute user paths that happen to coincide with ``base`` are
  accepted; any other absolute path is rejected.
* Missing intermediate components are tolerated — the caller is
  responsible for asserting the target exists (``.exists()``) if that
  matters. This matches ``open()``'s semantics and avoids a
  second-roundtrip race condition.

Not handled here (out of scope):

* TOCTOU between the ``safe_resolve`` call and the actual ``open``;
  a concurrent symlink swap can still redirect I/O. Mitigate with
  ``O_NOFOLLOW`` or a chroot / namespace.
* Windows reserved names (``CON``, ``PRN``, …) — not a path-traversal
  concern, but worth knowing.

        base: The trusted root directory. Must be a real, absolute
            path. If a relative ``Path`` or ``str`` is passed it is
            resolved first — the caller is expected to pass a location

            relative, contain ``..`` components, or be absolute. Will
            be rejected if the final resolved location lies outside
            ``base``.
