"""Runnable adapters — make non-``Agent`` shapes look like an Agent to
``AgentServer`` and ``A2AServer``.

Tulip's HTTP/SSE server and A2A server both consume the Agent contract::

    async for event in obj.run(prompt, thread_id=..., metadata=...) -> AsyncIterator[TulipEvent]

A ``StateGraph`` (or any object with a ``stream(inputs) -> AsyncIterator``)
does not natively satisfy that contract — its inputs are dicts, its
events are :class:`tulip.multiagent.graph.StreamEvent` instances, and
its final state is a dict.

:class:`GraphRunnable` is a thin shim that bridges those two surfaces.
Wrap a compiled graph and use it everywhere an ``Agent`` is expected:

.. code-block:: python

    from tulip.multiagent.graph import StateGraph
    from tulip.server import AgentServer, GraphRunnable
    from tulip.a2a import A2AServer, AgentSkill

    graph = StateGraph(...).compile()
    runnable = GraphRunnable(
        graph,
        input_key="prompt",  # str prompt → {"prompt": "..."}
        output_key="answer",  # final_state["answer"] → user-visible reply
    )

    # As an HTTP/SSE server:
    AgentServer(agent=runnable).run(port=8000)

    # As a spec-compliant A2A endpoint:
    A2AServer(
        agent=runnable,
        api_key="...",
        name="my-graph",
        skills=[AgentSkill(id="planner", name="Planner", description="...")],
    ).run(port=7421)

Closes #213. The adapter is intentionally minimal — it preserves the
caller's graph as-is and only translates the streaming surface.

    """Wrap a graph so :class:`AgentServer` / :class:`A2AServer` can publish it.

    The adapter speaks the Agent contract — ``async def run(prompt, *,
    thread_id=None, metadata=None) -> AsyncIterator[TulipEvent]`` — by
    driving ``graph.stream({input_key: prompt})`` underneath. Each per-node
    ``StreamEvent`` becomes a :class:`ThinkEvent` so SSE / A2A clients see
    activity in real time; the terminal final-state event becomes a
    :class:`TerminateEvent` with ``final_message`` set to
    ``final_state[output_key]`` (or the full state stringified when
    ``output_key`` is unset).

    Args:
        graph: A compiled :class:`StateGraph` (or any object with an
            async ``stream(inputs) -> AsyncIterator``). Duck-typed so
            future runnable shapes (compiled pipelines, custom DAGs)
            slot in unchanged.
        input_key: Key under which the user prompt is placed in the
            graph's initial state. Defaults to ``"prompt"`` because
            both ``KEY_PROMPT`` (deep research) and most StateGraph
            examples use that name.
        output_key: Key in the graph's final state that holds the
            user-visible reply. ``None`` (default) means stringify the
            whole final-state dict — usable for diagnostics but most
            callers will set this explicitly.
        name: Optional display name (echoed into ``ThinkEvent``
            reasoning lines so SSE consumers can tell graphs apart from
            agents).

    Notes:
        * ``thread_id`` and ``metadata`` from the server are accepted but
          not propagated yet — graphs don't have a native notion of a
          server-managed thread. Per-graph checkpointers handle the same
          concern at a different layer.
        * The adapter does NOT touch the agent loop; agents inside the
          graph keep emitting their own ``TulipEvent`` stream onto the
          tulip event bus. The shim only translates the *graph*'s outer
          stream.
