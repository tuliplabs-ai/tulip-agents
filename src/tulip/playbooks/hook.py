"""Hook adapter that wires :class:`PlaybookEnforcer` into the agent loop.

The enforcer in :mod:`tulip.playbooks.enforcer` was complete and well-tested
but disconnected from ``Agent`` — there was no automatic step-tracking
during a run. ``PlaybookEnforcerHook`` is the missing glue:

- ``on_before_tool_call`` calls ``enforcer.validate_tool_call(tool_name)``;
  if blocked, it sets ``event.cancel`` to the violation message so the
  agent loop turns the call into a no-op with a useful explanation.
- ``on_after_tool_call`` records the tool call and, when a step's
  ``expected_tools`` are all satisfied (or its ``max_tool_calls`` is
  reached), advances the plan via ``complete_current_step``.

This is the integration the README's "PlaybookEnforcer validates tool
calls against step constraints" claim was always describing — it just
hadn't been built.

    """Hook that enforces a :class:`Playbook` over an agent run.

    Holds a single :class:`PlaybookEnforcer` instance and dispatches
    ``before/after_tool_call`` events into it so step compliance is tracked
    automatically. Auto-advances to the next step when the current step's
    expected tool list is exhausted.

    Args:
        playbook: The playbook to enforce. A fresh ``PlaybookEnforcer`` is
            built from it on construction.
        block_violations: When True (default), a violating tool call is
            cancelled via ``event.cancel``. When False, violations are
            recorded but the call still runs.
        record_violations: When True (default), violations land on
            ``enforcer.violations`` for post-run inspection.
        priority: Hook priority. Defaults to a high value so the enforcer
            runs before observability / retry hooks; that way a blocked
            tool call doesn't get logged as if it had executed.

    Example:
        from tulip import Agent
        from tulip.playbooks.loader import load_playbook
